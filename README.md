# gw2-enhancements
A collection of gw2 QoL enhancements.

# What does it do?

* Save your left pinky: it can hold down left-ctrl for you, so you can better find chests in the Silverwastes, or coins in Dry Top.
* Save your clicking finger: it can hold down left-click for you, so you don't have to click to open 250+ bags at once.

# What are the hotkeys?
* Press CapsLock, which will hold down F11. You will need to bind `Miscellaneous -> Show Enemy Names` also to F11. If you accidentally turn CapsLock on, somehow, you can turn it off again by pressing Ctrl+CapsLock.
* Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A will spam left click for you. I recommend binding this to a gaming mouse button, but you can just use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+A.

# How do I set it up?

1. Download [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
2. Download `[gw2.ahk](https://github.com/seiyria/gw2-enhancements/blob/master/gw2.ahk)` and save it somewhere you will be running it from.
3. Double click `gw2.ahk` to run it.
4. Bind the necessary hotkeys however you want to.
